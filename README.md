# Project Express API

An API for Netflix data. Several endpoints are available, all of which can be seen on the root route "/".

## The problem

This is the first API that I am creating and at first I found it really hard to grasp, especially how the root route works and what it should contain. After asking chatGPT I could slowly see the logic. 

Since the backend code is way more sleek and neat compared to frontend, I felt I had time to add middleware in order to try out authentication.
